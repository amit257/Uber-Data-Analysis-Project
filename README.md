# Uber-Data-Analysis-Project
I maked this Project and  learn how to implement the ggplot2 on the Uber Pickups dataset and at the end, master the art of data visualization in R. This is more of a data visualization project that will guide you towards using the ggplot2 library for understanding the data and for developing an intuition for understanding the customers who avail the trips.
